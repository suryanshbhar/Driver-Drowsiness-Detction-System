# Driver Drowsiness Detection System
This webpage illustrates the application of Video Stream Processing and Neural Networks.
The user has to record and upload a video stream and application return a monitored video stream.<br>
The web application has been deployed using heroku and is available at <br>
https://driver-drowsiness-detector.herokuapp.com/
## Description
The project basically aims to provide a drowsiness detection system for vehicle drivers.<br>
Video preprocessing of the input video stream has been done using OpenCV Library.<br>
Convolutional neural network has been used as the predicting model built using tf-keras library.<br>
And 'cascade' files have been used as to extract different profiles of the user<br>
